# Sublime Text Cheatsheet

PDF cheatsheet for Sublime Text \[Mac\] (based on [this](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/8827/preparing-cheat-sheets) template).

Page 2 contains remapped and plug-in keybindings which are probably not very useful, unless you copy my [exact config](https://github.com/bsunter/sublime-text-config).
